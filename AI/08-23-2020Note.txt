single variable formula
y=mx+b(Linear Equation)

multiple variabe calculating
price=m1*area + m2*bedroom +m3*age +b (Linear Equation)


m is call     ==>slope or gradient (coef)
x is call     ==>indenpence value
y(b) is call     ==>Intercept
y is depend on x
price is call ==>horizonal value
area is call  ==>vertical value
price =>m * area + b
m ==>how to get best from fit line
blue line is==> best fit line
fit is ==>train
df is =>dataframe to get from csv file
